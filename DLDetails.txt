Road Test

But all locations start taking walk ins at 12 PM only.

They sometime if there's no show or less booking they may squeeze you in

Talked with person at Huntersville she said If you get there by 10 AM they can put you on the computer by 10.30AM and can make you hit the road around 11 AM - 12 PM. That will be the best thing you can try and do it on Wednesday - Thursday => 10 AM

Wed - Thur => 10 AM
