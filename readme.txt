Instructions:

Player is playing in randomly generated level with randomly generated guns. The player have to avoid touching enemies and kill them with gun. For now it might feel easy but it will get much more difficult as we complete the game. After each 10 levels we will have boss room with big boss. After every second level we will have shop room which is half implemented currently but it will allow player to purchase weapons. Try beating as many level as you can have fun.
